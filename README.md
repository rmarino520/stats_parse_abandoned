# stats_parse_abandoned
Abandoned project from 2019
09-23-20 - Initial repo creation. Figured I'd post my abandoned project from 2019. The idea was to:

Pull stats from nfl.com using beautifulsoup
Create mySQL database to store all data
Sort and upload base stats
Data analytics on all data and enter into new schema
Create website pulling data from DB
Might get back to it one day...
